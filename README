This fork was created to address a bug found in the PortCMIS library.
Unfortunately, the Apache Chemistry project has been retired and moved to the Apache Attic, which means there is no option to include my fix in the official repository (chemistry-portcmis).

I hope this fork helps someone understand the issue and apply the fix in their own codebase if needed.

This would have been the description of a pull request to chemistry-portcmis:
----
When accessing the `FolderParent` of a Folder, the wrong CMIS service is called.

The CMIS standard specifies that a folder must have exactly one parent, which should be retrieved using the `getFolderParent` service. However, in  PortCMIS, the `getObjectParents` service is used instead.

The standard also states that a Folder object should have the **allowable action** `canGetFolderParent`, but not `canGetObjectParents`. This discrepancy results  in an error because our CMIS server correctly returns false for the `canGetObjectParents` **allowable action**.

Sample Code:
Folder folder = (Folder)session.GetObject(*some-object-id*);
Folder parent = (Folder)folder.FolderParent; // error: Our server returns "The allowable action canGetObjectParents is set to false"

Fix:
In the getter function of `FolderParent` I changed the code so that the CMIS service `getFolderParent` is called.


Note:
_I understand that the PortCMIS project has been moved to the Apache Attic, but I believe I have found a bug in the library and would like to inquire if there is  any way to push my bug fix into the official repository._
